# Cryo's-RJW-Mod-Manager

So yeah, i created this file for our peeps on the Linux, MacOS, and Windows ecosystems using c0ffee's batch script as inspiration.
Uses base python packages to communicate with git and has the added feature of ssh connections if the user wants.

## If using SSH

If you are using ssh, make sure that you have keys stored on Github, GitLab, and GitGud for ssh access. I recommend ed25519 keys for key size and security.
Else, just use https, no harm no foul.
